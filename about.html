        Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world
          a little better. It was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.

        It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista – but each interaction is unique.
        It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.
        
        But it’s a connection....
        
        We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.
        
        From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.
